## Installation

TODO

## User and App Credentials

When you register an application on the Virgil developer's [dashboard](https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/dashboard), we provide you with an *appId*, *appKey* and *accessToken*.

* **appId** uniquely identifies your application in our services, it is also used to identify the Public key generated in a pair with *appKey*, for example: ```af6799a2f26376731abb9abf32b5f2ac0933013f42628498adb6b12702df1a87```
* **appKey** is a Private key that is used to perform creation and revocation of *Virgil Cards* (Public key) in Virgil services. Also the *appKey* can be used for cryptographic operations to take part in application logic. The *appKey* is generated at the time of application creation and has to be saved in secure place. 
* **accessToken** is a unique string value that provides an authenticated secure access to the Virgil services and is passed with each API call. The *accessToken* also allows the API to associate your app’s requests with your Virgil developer’s account. 

## Connecting to Virgil
Before you can use any Virgil services features in your app, you must first initialize ```Client``` class. You use the ```Client``` object to get access to Create, Revoke, Get and Search for *Virgil Cards* (Public keys). 

### Initializing an API Client

To create an instance of `Client` class, just call its constructor with your application's *accessToken* which you generated on developer's deshboard.

```cpp
Client client(<#Virgil App token#>);
```

### Initializing Crypto
The `Crypto` class provides cryptographic operations in applications, such as hashing, signature generation and verification, encryption and decryption.

```cpp
auto crypto = std::make_shared<Crypto>();
```
### Initializing Request Manager
The `RequestManager` class helps generating requests for creating or revoking cards. To make an instance of `RequestNamager` just call its constructor with *crypto*.

```cpp
RequestManager manager(crypto);
```

## Creating a Virgil Card

A *Virgil Card* is the main entity of the Virgil services, it includes the information about the user and his public key. The *Virgil Card* identifies the user/device by one of his types. 

Collect an *appId* and *appKey* for your app. These parametes are required to create a Virgil Card in your app scope.

```cpp
auto appId = <#String: Your appId#>;
auto appKeyPassword = <#String: You app key password#>;
auto privateAppKeyData = <#String: You app key data in Base64#>;

auto appPrivateKey = crypto->importPrivateKey(privateAppKeyData, appKeyPassword);
```

Generate a new Public/Private keypair using *Crypto* class. 

```cpp
auto aliceKeys = crypto->generateKeyPair();
```

Create a list of Card signers with their Ids and PrivateKeys - to sign request with them.

```cpp
std::list<CardSigner RequestSigners;
RequestSigners.push_back(
        CardSigner(appId, appPrivateKey)
);
```
Prapare Card parameters to make Card.
```cpp
CreateCardParams parameters(
      "Alice",                      //Identity
      "username",                   //IdentityType
      keyPair,                      //keyPair
      RequestSigners,               //RequestSigners
      true,                         //Signing request with owner - true by default
      data                          //CustomFields - not required
);
```

Making request using Request Manager and parameters. It will be already signed by signers you put into `parameters`.
```cpp
auto request = manager.CreateCardRequest(parameters);
```

Publish a Virgil Card
```cpp
auto future = client.createCard(request);

auto cardRaw = future.get();                                
```

You get `cardRaw`,which is a representation of card, given by services. To get an instance of `Card` you need to import it.

```cpp
auto card = Card::importRaw(crypto, cardRaw);
```

## Search for Virgil Cards
Performs the `Virgil Card`s search by criteria:
- the *Identities* request parameter is mandatory;
- the *IdentityType* is optional and specifies the *IdentityType* of a `Virgil Card`s to be found;
- the *Scope* optional request parameter specifies the scope to perform search on. Either 'global' or 'application';

```cpp
auto criteria = SearchCardsCriteria::createCriteria(CardScope::application, "username", {"alice", "bob"});

auto future = client.searchCards(criteria);

auto cards = future.get();
```

## Validating Virgil Cards
This sample uses *built-in* ```CardValidator``` to validate Virgil Service cards.

```cpp
auto validator = std::make_unique<CardValidator>(crypto);

// Your can also add another Public Key for verification.
// validator->addVerifier(<#Verifier card id#>, <#Verifier public key data#>);

auto isValid = validator->validateCard(card);
```

## Get a Virgil Card
```cpp
auto future = client.getCard(<#Your cardId#>);

auto cardRaw = future.get();

auto card = Card::importRaw(crypto, cardRaw);
```

## Revoking a Virgil Card

You can make Virgil Card unavailable for further use if its private key was compromised or for any other reason.

```cpp
RequestManager manager(crypto);

std::list<CardSigner> RequestSigners;
RequestSigners.push_back(
        CardSigner(consts.applicationId(), appPrivateKey)
);

RevokeCardParams parameters(
      <#Your cardId#>, 
      RequestSigners
);

auto request = manager.RevokeCardRequest(parameters);

auto future = client.revokeCard(request);

future.get();

```

## Operations with Crypto Keys

### Generate Keys
The following code sample illustrates keypair generation. The default algorithm is ed25519

```cpp
auto aliceKeys = crypto->generateKeyPair();
```

### Import and Export Keys
You can export and import your Public/Private keys to/from supported wire representation.

To export Public/Private keys, simply call one of the Export methods:

```cpp
auto alicePrivateKeyData = crypto->exportPrivateKey(aliceKeys.privateKey(), "password");
auto alicePublicKeyData = crypto->exportPublicKey(aliceKeys.publicKey());
```

To import Public/Private keys, simply call one of the Import methods.

**Note** that method `importPublicKey` returns a pointer for inheritance reason.

```cpp
auto alicePrivateKey = crypto->importPrivateKey(alicePrivateKeyData, "password");
auto alicePublicKeyPointer  = crypto->importPublicKey(alicePublicKeyData);
```


## Encryption and Decryption

Initialize Crypto API and generate keypair.

```cpp
auto crypto = std::make_shared<Crypto>();
auto keyPair = crypto->generateKeyPair();
```

### Encrypt Data
Data encryption using ECIES scheme with AES-GCM. You can encrypt either stream or data.
There also can be more than one recipient

*Data*
```cpp
auto plainTextData = VirgilByteArrayUtils::stringToBytes("Hello, Bob!");
auto encryptedData = crypto->encrypt(plainTextData, { aliceKeys.publicKey() });
```

*Stream*
```cpp
std::ifstream inputFileStream("input");
std::ofstream outputFileStream("output");

crypto->encrypt(inputFileStream, outputFileStream, { aliceKeys.publicKey() });
```

### Decrypt Data
You can decrypt either stream or data using your private key

*Data*
```cpp
auto decrytedData = crypto->decrypt(encryptedData, aliceKeys.privateKey());
```

*Stream*
```cpp
std::ifstream inputFileStream("input");
std::ofstream outputFileStream("output");

crypto->decrypt(inputFileStream, outputFileStream, aliceKeys.privateKey());
```

## Generating and Verifying Signatures
This section walks you through the steps necessary to use the *VirgilCrypto* to generate a digital signature for data and to verify that a signature is authentic.

### Generating a Signature

Sign the SHA-384 fingerprint of either stream or data using your private key. To generate the signature, simply call one of the sign methods:

*Data*
```cpp
auto plainTextData = VirgilByteArrayUtils::stringToBytes("Hello, Bob!");
auto signature = crypto->generateSignature(plainTextData, aliceKeys.privateKey());
```

*Stream*
```cpp
std::ifstream inputFileStream("input");
auto signature = crypto->generateSignature(plainTextData, aliceKeys.privateKey());
```

### Verifying a Signature

Verify the signature of the SHA-384 fingerprint of either stream or a data using Public key. The signature can now be verified by calling the verify method:

```cpp
auto isVerified = crypto->verify(data, signature, aliceKeys.publicKey());
```

*Stream*
```cpp
auto isVerified = crypto->verify(stream, signature, aliceKeys.publicKey());
```

## Authenticated Encryption
Virgil SDK contains convenient API for combining encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify procedures

*Sign and encrypt*
```cpp
auto signedAndEcryptedData = crypto->signThenEncrypt(data, senderPrivateKey, { receiverPublicKey });
```

*Decrypt and verify*
```cpp
auto decryptedAndVerifiedData = crypto->decryptThenVerify(signedAndEcryptedData, receiverPrivateKey, senderPublicKey);
```

## Fingerprint Generation
The default Fingerprint algorithm is SHA-256.
```cpp
auto fingerprint = crypto->calculateFingerprint(data);
```

## Card Id Generation
```cpp
auto cardId = CardIdGenerator::generate(crypto, snapshot);
```
